//Theodore Ruth - Java Chapter 10 - Exercise 3
1. 
main(box1 = a, p1 = b, p2 =b)
findCenter(box = a, x = 5, y = 8)
printPoint(p = b)
findCenter(box = a, x = 5, y = 8)
printPoint(p = b)
a(x = 1, y = 3, width = 8, height = 10)
b(x = 5, y = 8)

2. The program outputs:
(5, 8)
(5, 8)

3. p1 and p2 are aliased at the end of main because they have the same data
and the compiler doesn't make more objects with the same vaules.
